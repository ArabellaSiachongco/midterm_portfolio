          I've transformed my life, and I believe you can do the same.

          I discovered comfort in exploring manhua, but at a certain point, I
          felt a sense of longing while witnessing others pursue their dreams.
          Recognizing these feelings, I made a conscious decision to break free
          from the cycle of uncertainty and embarked on a journey towards
          personal growth. Amidst the challenges and self-doubt, I chose to
          embrace positivity as my guiding mantra. This shift in mindset has
          allowed me to find genuine joy in letting life's unpredictable waves
          shape my future.

          In 2022, I took a significant step forward by enrolling at the
          University of the Cordilleras, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Web
          Technology, while simultaneously participating in Kodego. This
          decision was fueled by my sincere passion for coding. Contrary to
          initial expectations, the University of the Cordilleras experienced
          delays in introducing basic HTML and CSS.
        </div>
        <div class="text1">
          As a result, I learned through platforms like Free Code Camp, which
          turned out to be a valuable experience. While I consider myself a
          continuous learner, I approach challenges with enthusiasm, relying on
          YouTube tutorials to grasp concepts and applying them with minor
          modifications to suit my unique style.

          Despite occasional procrastination challenges, I view them as
          opportunities for self-improvement. Each obstacle becomes a stepping
          stone towards honing my skills and overcoming any barriers in my
          educational journey. I will continue to navigate towards a future
          filled with bright possibilities.
